- 👋 Hi there, I’m @sujirapornpak
- 👀 I’m a molecular biologist/bioinformatician intrigued in systems biology and computational biology (esp. machine learning). 
- 🌱 My current research interests center around a network-based approach not only to explain the disease mechanism, but also to understand an evolutionary
process of biological systems.
- 💞️ Committing as a life-long learner, I wish to advance the fundamental research in lifescience by standing on the shoulders of AI/ML as new interdisciplinary paradigms.  
- 📫 You can reach me at pakchuen.suji@gmail.com
